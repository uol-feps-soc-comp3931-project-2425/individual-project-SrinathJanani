Progress Notes :

29/1/2025 Notes

Code finally works using Ohollo's Chord Detection
• python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.9 and 3.10 did not work
-> python version 3.8 finally worked
• vamp continuously threw errors during installment
-> vamp had to be manually downloaded and configured to path
• the library threw errors when pip installing
-> the library had to be installed using the GitHub url
• there were multiple complications with other required libraries and library versions (example, numpy)
-> these issues somehow resolved automatically after completing the above fixes
• other chord detection libraries offered similar issues and bugs
• often libraries or required components didn't have helpful enough documentation

After much deliberation and testing, the chord detection library has successfully been installed for python3.8

Implemented Features :
• defining the extractor object (courtesy of Chordino)
• extracting chords and their respective timestamps from locally stored songs (one at a time)
• storing the above features from a 'ChordChange' object instead into arrays
• splicing the storage location to obtain the song name and artist

Upcoming Features :
• designing an object to store
  - song name
  - music artist
  - key signature
  - chord progression (universal notation) with timestamps (dictionary/array)
  - (optional - release date)
• creating a naming convention for song files, which must include
  - song name
  - music artist
  - key signature (to make universal chord progression notation)
• looping over extracting from multiple songs (say, in a folder)
• verifying detection accuracy (currently speculated at roughly 80%)

Future Implementations :
• compiling database of songs (possible to use top X number of songs on spotify for each year over a duration of time)
• researching on machine learning technique to classify and regress data
• installing and importing machine learning models
• training the model against the data, and subsequently testing for similarities with new songs

Additional Possibilities :
• designing an app to interact with data and display outputs
• designing a method to record audio, from which chords can be extracted
